        <ol>
            <li>Ensure there are 20 attack cards for each element.</li>

            <li>Each player will choose and state which monster they will scan in play order.</li>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>If the ability states damage, deal that amount of damage instead of 100 times
                                        the number of attack cards.</li>
                                </ul>

                    <li>After calculating, establish whether the opposing monster is knocked out.
                        <ul>
                            <li>If knocked out, the opponent will choose a new monster to scan and display in the 3D
                                box.</li>
                        </ul>
